# Rotation-Detection-Enhanced-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Modified CNN Model which is rotation detection enhanced



`Train_CNN.py` and `Train_RDECNN.py` are used to train two models
Each of them has "train()-use only original images" and "mixed_train()-use both original and rotated images" methods

Each of them has "test()-use only original images" and "polluted_test()()-use only rotated images" methods
